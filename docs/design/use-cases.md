# User stories

## Original User Stories from the Use Case Definition Document (*UC*)

- **UC68**: As a user, I want automated checks to verify the continued correct
end-to-end functioning of my published workflows, so that I can
receive notification when there is a problem
- **UC69**: As a user, I want automated checks to verify the continued
availability of my published datasets, so that I can receive
notification when there is a problem. Availability of the dataset
refers to discovery in the Catalogue and access via Data Retrieval
and Visualisation services
- **UC70**: As a user, I want KPIs to be recorded for my published service, in
order to demonstrate that I have met the SLA of my NoR offering.
In this context, as a published service includes published datasets,
workflows, ML models, Dashboards, etc.

## Target users

### APEx

From page 9 of **UC**:
> The Algorithm Hosting Service will provide a registry of hosted services, in which hosted
applications are registered and published so that they are discoverable and available for
reuse by other projects. This is supported in EOEPCA+ by the Resource Register,
**Resource Health Check** and Resource Discovery use cases.
