# Level 3
The final level of additional functionality is to ensure the timely execution of health-check scripts according to requested schedules and triggers. This is the only level of functionality that strictly relies on the notification and automation building block.

This functionality is achieved by executing the health check Kubernetes CronJobs on the provided schedule (Kubernetes takes care of that) and by providing an API endpoint which can be called to trigger a check execution either manually or upon notifications from some other source, e.g. notifications from the notification and automation building block.
